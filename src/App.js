        Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/ (About this soundlisten) wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə or
        /ˌwɪki-/ (About this soundlisten) wik-ee-) is a multilingual
        open-collaborative online encyclopedia created and maintained by a
        community of volunteer editors using a wiki-based editing system. It is
        one of the 15 most popular websites as ranked by Alexa, as of January
        2021[3] and The Economist newspaper placed it as the "13th-most-visited
        place on the web".[4] Featuring no advertisements, it is hosted by the
        Wikimedia Foundation, an American non-profit organization funded
        primarily through donations. Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001,
        by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Sanger coined its name[5][6] as a
        portmanteau of "wiki" and "encyclopedia". It was initially an
        English-language encyclopedia, but versions in other languages were
        quickly developed. With 6.2 million articles, the English Wikipedia is
        the largest of the 317 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia
        comprises more than 55 million articles,[7] attracting 1.7 billion
        unique visitors per month.[8][9] Wikipedia has been criticized for its
        uneven accuracy and for exhibiting systemic bias, including gender bias,
        with the majority of editors being male.[4] Edit-a-thons have been held
        to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's
        topics.[10] In 2006, Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of
        allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the
        best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of
        Jimmy Wales.[11] The project's reputation improved further in the 2010s
        as it increased efforts to improve its quality and reliability, based on
        its unique structure, curation and absence of commercial bias.[4] In
        2018, Facebook and YouTube announced that they would help users detect
        fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles.[12]
